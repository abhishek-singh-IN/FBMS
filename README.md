football management System
My project, namely, Football Management System is a record keeping system. The project is based on the Premier League organized every year. According to our database, we have 10 teams or Clubs out of which only 8 qualify for the league. We have kept a record of the teams, players, stadiums, coaches, matches and most importantly the Rank List for two seasons (2015, 2016). A total of 56 matches are scheduled in a season and every team faces all others twice. 3 points are awarded to the winning team and 0 to the other. In case of a draw, both the teams are awarded 1 point each. At the end of the season the team having maximum points is the winner. The last two teams do not qualify for the next season. Our database implements suitable integrity constraints.
